# Optuna configs

Use from `src`:

```bash
./scripts/run_optuna.sh --config configs/optuna/sparse_jaguar_muon.json
```

Per-trial local logging is enabled by default. To keep only the final
`best_params.json` summary with the best Optuna parameters and their
`test_accuracy`, run:

```bash
LOG_TRIALS=false ./scripts/run_optuna.sh --config configs/optuna/sparse_jaguar_muon.json
```

Each config is self-contained: `base_args` explicitly includes fixed launch
parameters such as `model_name`, `task_name`, dataset sizes, logging settings,
scheduler settings, `max_steps: 20000`, `num_training_steps: 20000`, and
`save_strategy: "no"`. Each trial logs to WandB via `use_wandb: true` and
`report_to: "wandb"`. `tau` is mapped to `zo_eps` because `zo_tau` is currently
not consumed by the LLM trainer.

Only configs for optimizers present in this repository are included.

Optuna trial tags, which are also used as WandB run names, include the study,
trainer, task, short model name, tuning mode, and trial number, for example:
`optuna/study/sparse_jaguar_muon-SST2-roberta-large-lora/trial_0`.
